Course content and assignments on "Automated Reasoning: Satisfiability" course by EIT Digital on [coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/learn/automated-reasoning-sat).

The course is taught by [Prof. Hans Zantema] (https://www.coursera.org/instructor/hanszantema), who is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and part time Full Professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen.

The course focuses on learning how to apply satisfiability (SAT/SMT) tools to solve a wide range of practical problems.
Several basic examples are given to get the flavor of the applications: fitting rectangles to be applied for printing posters, scheduling problems, solving puzzles, 
and program correctness. Also underlying theory is presented: resolution as a basic approach for propositional satisfiability, the CDCL framework to scale up for big formulas,
and the simplex method to deal with linear inequallities.

Z3 SMT solver (a cross-platform satisfiability modulo theories solver by Microsoft) is used for solving all the honor assignemnts. 
Here is the basic information on [Z3] (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki#background).
This project comprises of all the code that has been used for solving the assignemnts.
